Also I would like to hear from you, if you find a good use for my art, so contact me or drop me a link.

----------------------

First I build this art for learning purposes since I just started with learning modeling and game art,
for fun and for my game project. I tried to build an authentic and harmonius environment, at first my 
skills were very amateurish, but I had quite a lot of stuff, so I took some time and overworked everything
I've done so far that looked useful to create a pack that others can use, so it does not get lost
and all is free since I like freedom and want to support open source and indie game developers.


All is tested, since I build several levels with it, that come with this pack,
that fully work for simple multiplayer/deathmatch games, just the game mechanics are missing.

----------------------

Install instructions:

The "Torque3D"-folder contains the game-ready files and they can be extracted with the given folder structure into your
Torque3D-project mainfolder and everything will be in its place. You can also unzip the folders to where you want by hand,
but then you will possibly have to correct the filepaths by hand later.
If you get prompted when unzipping, if you want to overwrite files like materials.cs or forest\brushes.cs you can do that if
you use a fresh or empty project, otherwise you can open the .cs file in notepad and copy over the content into your existing
file or set the models up again in the ingame editor also you can move "materials.cs" to another folder, it does not matter 
where they are placed.

The forest editor script files brushes.cs and managedItemData.cs should better not be edited or have entries deleted in 
the ingame editor, since there are some bugs in Torque related to this, but for running the levels it should work, 
otherwise use a clean template and copy over.


The "source"-folder contains the source files, so if you want to edit something, use it to create something new or use it for
another engine, it will likely be better to use these versions. The .blend files are opened with blender, so if you use blender 
these will be more comfortable to use, otherwise the .dae versions can also be imported and .xcf files are for gimp.

In the trees folder you will find some subfolders called tree_d or ngplant, there I placed the source files from the tree 
generating software I used and also textures, these programs are freeware and with these files you will have a template 
to create additional variations of the tree if you need, but look at the other files first, because the export/import 
process can be quite complicated.



Tested with a version of Torque3D 3.0

----------------------

Content:

-50 individual models

-10 individual terrain layers

-12 cloud/sky layer textures

-25 grass/plant sprites

-riverside_promenade level

-lonerock_island level

-volcav_island level

-1 ambience sound file

----------------------

But this is not limited to Torque 3.0, I just build it around and setup for this engine, so if you want to use it elsewhere
you have to find out yourself how to export/import. Only the levels will likely be limited to Torque3D only and some other
things may have to be adapted for other purposes, since adapting the art to the engine to fit the engine and look harmonious
was one of the most time consuming parts while creating this art-pack.
