GPU noise is a OpenGL Compute shader implementation of the super awesome liNoise project.  It provides several modules that can be combined together in a module tree used to create textures. 

The library contains the following modules

AutoCorrect-
	AutoCorrect takes an input texture (heightmap) and rescales all the values so that they fit in the range 0..1.  For example, an input noise texture may have values between 0..1.5, but needs to be rescaled to 0..1.  AutoCorrect will find the min/max value in the texture and then rescale every value so they in the range.s

Bias-Biases the input value towards the bias value

Combiner-Combines multiple (up to 8) values into a single value using a math operation (add, subtract, mult, max, min, avg)

Constant-generate a constant values

Fractal-Using multiple values of simplex noise, generates different types of fractal brownian motion.  Supports fBm, multifractal, ridgedmultifractal, and hybridmultifractal

Gradient-Generate a gradient along an arbitrary axis 

Scale-Scale the input value by a either a constant value or the value of an input image

Select-Given two inputs, blend between them using a third input image to determine how much of each of the inputs to use

Translate-Translate the input input image in the x,y directions
